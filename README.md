How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
Code can be ensured as being funcitonal and secure by going through both static and dynamic testing methods.  By testing functionality based on requirements you can make sure this is done effectively. 

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
I interpret user needs by gaining insight on what they're looking to get from the program.  Then it is easier to work together to set parameters that translate into a program.  
Throughout the design process you can work with clients to ensure that the user experience is what they aim for.  
Testing also allows you to ensure that the user is getting the best experience by becoming a user yourself, or by acquiring others to test as users for you. 

How do I approach designing software?
I approach designing software by first assessing the requirements set by the client.  By learning what they're looking to get out of it you can get a baseline of what the software should do and look like.  After this step, it's important to ensure you're building opportunities to test the code.  This makes sure the code is functional and doesn't have errors that will turn off the user.
